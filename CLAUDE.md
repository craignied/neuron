# neuron-3.0

Reanimation of **neUROn2++** — Craig's neural computational modeling environment — as a
modern project. This directory is the new home; the legacy code is read-only reference.

## Lineage

- **neUROn** (1992) — original, begun by Craig Niederberger
- **neUROn2++** (1996 → C++, 2000 → full OO redesign, 2007 → GNU autotools distribution)
- Last release: **2.6.4** (Sep 2016, macOS/Homebrew build instructions). configure.ac says 2.64.
- Substantial contributors over the years: Vinod Kutty, Yuan Qin, Joe Jovero, Young Hong,
  Kai Liu, Richard Schoor, Gaurav Bansal, Ashay Kparker, Hui Liu, Tony Makhlouf.
- **neuron-3.0** (2026) — this reanimation.

## Legacy codebase (`../distro/`)

Interactive menu-driven CLI (`neuron`): specify dataset → specify model → use model →
discriminant function analysis. C++ with GNU autotools, depends on **GSL** (tested against
GSL 1.9–1.10; modern GSL is 2.x — untested).

### Source map (`../distro/src/`)

| Files | What |
|---|---|
| `neuron.cpp` | Main driver: menus, program flow |
| `model.{h,cpp}`, `network.{h,cpp}`, `iterative.{h,cpp}` | Abstract model / network / iterative-training base classes |
| `simpleprop`, `bareprop`, `backprop` | Feed-forward neural nets trained by backpropagation (three implementations of increasing sophistication) |
| `logistic.{h,cpp}` | Binary logistic regression — weight decay, gradient methods, conjugate gradient descent, Shanno's algorithm, Wald tests, condition number |
| `ldfa`, `qdfa`, `dfa` | Linear & quadratic discriminant function analysis |
| `regressnet.{h,cpp}` | Stepwise regression over network inputs |
| `dataset.{h,cpp}`, `twoset.{h,cpp}` | Dataset loading, train/test randomization, ROC reporting, classification tables |
| `stats.{h,cpp}` | Statistics: Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Pearson chi-square, Hosmer–Lemeshow, error functions |
| `matrix.{h,cpp}`, `vector_ops.{h,cpp}` | Templated matrix/vector math (matrix.h is 67 KB of templates) |
| `utility.{h,cpp}`, `function_defs.h` | Console I/O helpers, activation function definitions |

### Other legacy assets

- `../distro/doc/manifest.pdf` — the full manual (manifest.tex source). `spin.html` is a tutorial.
  **Copied into `docs/` here** (see below).
- `../distro/scripts/` — model exporters: `neuron2html.pl` (model → standalone HTML calculator),
  `neuron2palm.pl`, `neuron2iphone.rb`, plus `mkdataset.pl`. Documented in manifest.pdf ch. 11.
  **Not carried forward** (see decisions).
- `../distro/data/` — sample datasets: PSA (`psa_defs.txt`, `ordata`), low birthweight
  (`lowbwt2-2*`), XOR, BP40 train/test.
- `../distro/neuron-2.6*.tar.gz` — release tarballs 2.6 through 2.64.

### Legacy build status on this machine (verified 2026-07-11)

- **2.64 builds clean on Apple Silicon** — zero source changes, modern clang++ (C++14
  default) + Homebrew GSL 2.8. Only warnings: `std::unary_function` deprecation in
  `function_defs.h` (would break under `-std=c++17`).
- Reference build + scripted XOR smoke test live in `baseline/` (see its README).
  XOR trains to 100% CA with full stats output; weight randomization is unseeded, so
  runs are nondeterministic — compare endpoint statistics, not traces.
- The old `../distro/src/neuron` binary is x86_64; ignore it, rebuild via
  `baseline/build_legacy.sh`.
- Program quirks: greets as "2.63" (stale pre-generated configure in the 2.64 tarball);
  writes `model.txt` + `neuron.log` logs into its cwd.

## neuron-3.0 direction — DECIDED (2026-07-11)

1. **Language/stack: hybrid.** C++ for the engine — speed matters. Python for data
   grooming and everything around the engine.
2. **Interface: KISS.** Keep it simple and portable — porting to other systems is a
   priority, so no web UI, no heavy frameworks. Simple CLI.
3. **Scope: full engine port.** The statistical parts (goodness-of-fit, ROC, Wald,
   condition numbers, DFA, logistic regression, stepwise) are the novel and useful pieces —
   they all come along, together with the neural nets.
4. **Exporters: dropped.** The HTML/Palm/iPhone exporters are not carried forward — in the
   current era an LLM can generate a calculator from a saved model directly.

## Docs (`docs/`)

Legacy documentation copied from `../distro/doc/` (2026-07-11):

- `docs/manifest.pdf` — the full neUROn2++ manual (ch. 11 covers the dropped exporters)
- `docs/spin.html` — tutorial (self-contained, no external assets)
- `docs/maths.pdf`, `bareprop.pdf`, `network.pdf`, `driver.pdf` — algorithm/design docs
- `docs/tex/` — LaTeX sources (grep-able; `manifest.tex` is the searchable form of the
  manual) + `figures/` with small PDF versions of the manifest figures. The original
  `manifest.tex` references multi-MB `.bmp` scans that were deliberately NOT copied;
  a rebuild would need `\includegraphics` switched to the PDF figures.

## Housekeeping deferred by Craig

- **No GitHub remote and no global-memory writes yet** — Craig wants to work a while first;
  if the project proves worth it, he'll create a GitHub repo and then we enroll memory
  (claude-memory symlink) and push. Don't do either until he says so.

## Status

- **2026-07-11** — Project reanimated: explored `../distro`, wrote CLAUDE.md + README.md,
  initialized git (branch `main`). Direction decided (see above); legacy docs pulled into
  `docs/`.
- **2026-07-11 (later)** — Legacy 2.64 verified working as the numerical oracle: built
  arm64 against GSL 2.8, ran a scripted XOR session end-to-end (100% CA, ROC 1.0, K-S /
  Pearson / H-L stats all exercised). Harness committed in `baseline/`.
- **2026-07-11 (evening)** — **neuron 3.0.0-dev is alive.** Strategy: carry the legacy
  engine forward as the 3.0 base and modernize in place (not a ground-up rewrite).
  Done: legacy source copied to `engine/src/`, made C++17-clean (dropped 5
  `unary_function` inheritances in function_defs.h, stripped 6 `throw(DivisionByZero)`
  specs in twoset.{h,cpp}), `config.h` → `version.h` (NEURON_PACKAGE_STRING),
  top-level CMakeLists.txt (C++17, `find_package(GSL)`), builds with **zero warnings**.
  Verified two ways: (1) XOR training run — same endpoint stats as legacy;
  (2) `baseline/verify_oracle.sh` — legacy trains & saves a network, both binaries load
  the same weights and do an eta-0 forward pass, outputs **numerically identical**
  (diff-clean). Note: `distro/data/Run9` (11-input SimpleProp) has no matching dataset
  in distro/data (BP40 files are 13-col), so the oracle check generates its own network.
  Next: modernization passes on the engine (memory safety — raw new/delete →
  smart pointers; `matrix.h` templates; seedable RNG for reproducible training),
  then start `tools/` (Python data grooming, replacing mkdataset.pl).
